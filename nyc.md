https://www.yelp.com/biz/ippudo-east-village-new-york << some of the best ramen in nyc. wait can be long but the pork buns which they serve at the bar while you wait are amazing.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-east-village-new-york << amazing lobster and crab rolls. hole in the wall. quick bite. but awesomest.

https://goo.gl/maps/BLeKgjt8X8y << possibly the best burger in nyc. that's a hard title to give/earn. i don't know about their other food but the burger...

shake shack (there is one at 23rd and another one downtown) is a classic nyc burger place. nice to have one in the park.

eataly [food market] !! look it up...

# speakeasies

https://www.yelp.com/biz/angels-share-new-york << amazing speakeasy. long wait. you walk up the stairs for the restaurant and right at the top of the stairs there is an unassuming door. that's the door to the speakeasy.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/please-dont-tell-new-york-2 << another awesome speakeasy. you go inside criff dog. you go into the phone booth, pick up the phone. and they put you on the list this way.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/death-and-co-new-york-3 << another nice cocktail bar. this one might not have any wait and it's not technically a speakeasy. it's just not super obvious that it exists from the street.

if you have any time to spare i would consider going to the cloisters. https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/met-cloisters

https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-lot-radio-kiosk-brooklyn << if you feel like hipster vibes and it's sunny i would consider having a drink at the lot ratio (live internet radio station where some of the biggest and the smallest names have played <> from nina kravitz to some kid from the middle of nowhere living in brooklyn).

...obvs the met, the whitney, moma, the new museum... but those are obvious. you don't really need my recommendation for them.
